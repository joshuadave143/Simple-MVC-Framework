# Simple MVC Framework

## Description
 In my current role, I was entrusted with optimizing reports within our existing software. The task revealed that the vanilla PHP source code was in disarray, making it a challenge to maintain and decipher. Recognizing the need for a robust solution, I embarked on the journey of creating a tailored MVC framework for the report module. By integrating PropelORM in the model layer, I aimed to streamline data management. While I acknowledge that this approach may not represent the pinnacle of MVC implementation, it stands as a testament to the extensive knowledge and expertise I invested. Through this endeavor, I not only address report loading times but also lay a strong foundation for future enhancements. The process of developing this simple MVC has been a tremendous learning experience, enriching my skill set and expanding my capabilities in software development.

## Requirements
- PHP >=8.0 
- Composer
- PropelORM
